  <!-- this part is to explain why i like the game -->
<div class="reason">
  <h3>Why I love the game!</h3>
  <p id="p2">The reason I love this game is because it focuses a lot on game sense and it allows you to outsmart other players using map knowlegde and player abilities. <br>
  Another reason is because it is a team based game, meaning that all other players have to communicate and create strategies in order to win rounds and matches. <br>
  It gives me a good feeling of achievement when you are able to make plays that no one expects and flank people from behind to get as much kills as possible, <br>
however, the game requires you to have an idea of the map in order to be able to successfully cover them and to be aware of where the players are at the same time. </p>
