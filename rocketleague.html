      <h3>Why I love the game!</h3>
      <p id="p2" >the reason i love this game is because its a fast-paced game where you are able to show your skills and mechanics in the field as you play with your team mates or alone.<br>
      it also is really fun to play with your friends, and you can be creative with your mechanics and show how good of a player you are.<br>
    the game requires a lot of game time and practice to be able to use mechanics properly as it gets more competitive as you progress in the game.  </p>
